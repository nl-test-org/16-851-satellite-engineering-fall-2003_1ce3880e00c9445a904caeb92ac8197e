description: 'Problem set and solution.

  Problem statement: A manned mission to Mars poses several significant technological
  challenges for engineers. One such challenge is to minimize the physiological impact
  on the astronauts during prolonged spaceflight. A possible solution to this is using
  artificial gravity. Create a tool to evaluate the feasibility of an artificial gravity
  Mars mission.'
